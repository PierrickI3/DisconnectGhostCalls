# PureCloud Disconnect Ghost Calls

This tool is used to disconnect *Ghost Calls* (calls that might get stuck due to PureCloud failing to reach an edge).
This tool should *ONLY* be used when absolutely required.

> A `Ghost Call` is a call that is less than 24 hours old, not disconnected which last participant is on the selected offline (as seen by PureCloud) edge

## I don't want to take this responsibility!

The application does its best at finding calls that are still active on an offline edge.
To help you understand if there is indeed an issue with your PureCloud organization, we have added extra items:

### Agent stats

Agent stats show the number of `Logged in` agents and the number of agents in a `Not Responding` status. This refreshes every 5 seconds. 

If you see the number of `Not Responding` agents increasing, this means that PureCloud is alerting agents with a call it can't control. 

> You need to act!

### Troubleshooting

The `Troubleshooting` section is here to help you query a few things about specific conversations:

* Enter a conversation id
* Click on `Get Details` to get the current state of the conversation. You can use this to analyze the `Participants`, `Sessions` and `Segments` on that conversation.

### Ghost Call Test

This section is to let you test whether a call is actually a *Ghost Call* by running the same logic the app uses when it tries to find *Ghost Calls* for you.
* Enter a conversation id
* Set the `Start` and `End` date/time controls in the range when this call was initiated
> If you do not know the start and end date/time, use the `Get Details` button above
* Click on `Is this a Ghost Call?` button and a new dialog will appear with whether or not it thinks this conversation is a `Ghost Call`
